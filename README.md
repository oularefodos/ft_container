# Custom Containers in C++

## About The Project
This project delves into the realm of data structures and algorithms by constructing custom containers in C++. Our focus lies on implementing essential data structures such as map, set, and vector, while also showcasing proficiency in C++ programming and understanding of advanced data structures like Red-Black Trees.

### Implemented Data Structures:
- **Map:** An associative container that stores elements formed by a combination of a key and a mapped value. Utilizes Red-Black Tree for efficient key-value lookup.
- **Set:** A container that stores unique elements following a specific order. Implemented with Red-Black Tree for efficient element retrieval and insertion.
- **Vector:** A dynamic array that provides constant time access to individual elements. Utilizes dynamic memory allocation and resizing.

## Red-Black Tree Algorithm
Our custom containers employ the Red-Black Tree algorithm to ensure balanced and efficient operations.

### Red-Black Tree Features:
- **Balanced Structure:** Red-Black Trees maintain a balanced structure, ensuring logarithmic time complexity for operations.
- **Coloring:** Nodes in the tree are colored red or black, with specific rules governing their arrangement to maintain balance.
- **Rotations:** Rotations are performed to maintain the balanced properties of the tree during insertion and deletion operations.
